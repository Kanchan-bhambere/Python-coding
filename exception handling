Error are problems in program that stops the execution of programs. e.g syntax error
Exception is nothing but the runtime error, it occuers due to incorrect implementation of logic.
Exception handling is mechanism through which we can handle the runtime errors.

In try block we write code in which we are excepting the runtime error

A=10
B=0
print(A/B)
o/p---->>> Its give the zero division error

a=10
b=0
try:
  c=a/b
  print("Result is a : ", c)
except:
  print("Exception Handle")
Else:
  print("Kanchan")
o/p------>>> Exception Handle


a=10
b=2
try:
  c=a/b
  print("Result is a : ", c)
except:
  print("Exception Handle")
Else:
  print("Kanchan")
  
o/p------>>> Result is a : 5
             Kanchan

try except & finally
try:
  # Some code that may raise an exception
except:
  # Handling specific exception
   print(..)
finally:
  # Code that always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not
    print("Finally block executed")

# Custom exception

class myexception(Exception):
    pass
class error(myexception):
    pass
year=int(input("Enter your DOB year: "))
age=2024-year
try:
    if 31>age>=18:
        print("You are eligible for voting")
    else:
        raise error
except error:
    print("You are not eligible for the voting")
    
finally:
    print("You are eligible for Adhar card")
o/p----->>> Enter your DOB year: 2021
            You are not eligible for the voting
            You are eligible for Adhar card
